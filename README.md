# A Comparative Study of Image Segmentation Methods

This project tests a variety of different image segmentation methods by performing image segmentation on a dataset of single-object images. We will score the results of each method by performing image classification with a single model on the segmented images and recording the accuracy. The better each object is segmented from the images the higher the accuracy of the classification model on those segmented objects. Then we will compare the scores of each method to get an idea of their strengths and weaknesses.
